This repositery contains the source code for a master's degree project. It aims to provide useful tools to manipulate and analyse data coming from RANS simulations with perturbated fields. 
You can see practical examples inside this [notebook](https://github.com/Janken1401/Jet_Turbulent/blob/master/src/Jupyter_script/How_to_Guide.ipynb).
